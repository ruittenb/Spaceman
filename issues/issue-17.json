  "body": "I’m using Spaceman to name and manage Spaces (e.g. “Work” and “Home”), and I rely on macOS’s built-in app assignment feature:\n\nDock → Right-click app → Options → Assign To → This Desktop\n\n## Issue\n\nAfter restarting macOS, app assignments are sometimes swapped between Spaces. This does not happen on every restart and appears somewhat random, but occurs often enough to be disruptive. This has been a long-standing issue observed across multiple macOS / OS X versions.\n\nExample:\n- Before restart:\n  - Space “Work”: work-related apps assigned\n  - Space “Home”: personal/home apps assigned\n- After restart (occasionally):\n  - “Work” Space contains apps previously assigned to “Home”\n  - “Home” Space contains apps previously assigned to “Work”\n\nIt seems like app assignments may be preserved by Space index/order rather than by the logical Space identity or name, and that when Spaces are recreated or reordered during startup, apps can end up attached to the wrong Space.\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nApps assigned to a Space should remain associated with the same logical (or named) Space across restarts.\n\n## Actual behavior\n\nAfter some macOS restarts, apps are assigned to the wrong Space.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Occurs intermittently / non-deterministically\n- Long-standing issue across multiple macOS / OS X versions\n- Only observed when using named Spaces via Spaceman\n- macOS version: 26.2 (25C56)\n- Spaceman version: 1.13.0\n\nHappy to provide logs, repro attempts, or additional details if helpful.",
